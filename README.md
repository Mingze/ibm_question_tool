# IBM Watson Question Collection Tool (WATSON QCT)

This tool is used by GBS France and Watson France groupe to collect customer questions to creat intents and variations in Watson Conversation API. This tool is initially used by IBM Watson Lab Services to help collect questions for Watson Engagement Advisor (WEA).

The tool is developped on Node.js to provide a simple UI for users to enter questions which are stored in a database Cloudant. You can either run it in local or deploy it on IBM Bluemix.

## Customizations
You can make serveral changes in the "configuration database" that you defined in Cloudant:

### Change the text shown:
Change it on the home page: `./views/home.hbs`. There are 3 sections in this application with ids: intro, one, two. You can change any texts/icons/images you want.

### Change the counter for domain.
Each time you change the domain we can see how many questions per domain were submitted. To change it: Go to `/views/home.hbs`. 
```sh
<p><span id="collected"></span> sur 1500 collect√©es dans ce domaine!</p>
...

...
var count = 0;
      var deferred = request(url, options);
      deferred.then(function(result) {
          result.questions.forEach(function(field) {

            questionsCollected += field.question;

            field.profile_fields.forEach(function(field1){
              //console.log(field1.value)
                if(field1.value.trim()==domaine.trim()){
                
                count++
                };
              })
          });
    document.getElementById("collected").innerHTML=count;
```
### Change the cookie expiration
Update the "cookie_expiration" property to the desired value, the time unit is in days
### Change the questions goal
Update the "questions_goal" property to the desired value, by defaut the value is 2000.
### Change the help text
Update the "help_text" property to the desired text, this will be display unter the question input text box.
### Change the profile fields
The interface can dynamically show profile fields for users to enter values for. These profile fields are controlled by the "profile_fields" property. The fields will be displayed under the "Your profile" section. Currently, we only support select drop-down list fields.
To do so: update the "profile_fields" contents where each section of the array is a separate field like the following:
```
    {
      "id": "domaine",
      "type": "select",
      "display": "domaine
      "values": [
        "domain 1",
        "domain 2",
        "domain 3",
      ]
    },
```
You can modify the "id" and "display" values to represent the type of profile value you want the users to enter
### Add a customer log on the Authentification page:
Change the login.html locats in `/public/login.html`, modify the img that you put in `/public/images`:
```html
  <div class="logo">
      <img src="images/ibm2.gif">
    </div>
```
### Change the scenario text:
Go to `.../views/home.hbs`, change the list scenario and put your scenarios separated by ",".

```html
/*Add scenarios*/
var scenario =[
"Scenario 1: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur",
"Scenario 2: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur",
"Scenario 3: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur",
"Scenario 4: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur",
"Scenario 5: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur",
"Scenario 6: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur",
